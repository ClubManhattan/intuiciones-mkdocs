### Mensaje por el Black Friday 2023:

 Black Friday madness is upon us once again and brands across the world are going into hyperdrive, pushing their ‘BUY! BUY! BUY!’ messaging across platforms. However, what we need to ask ourselves is… do we really need that shiny new thing? Here are four things everyone should try to do before hitting that Buy button.
 
1. FIX WHAT'S BROKEN

Sure, a scratched-up display or a sluggish battery might seem like a good enough reason to splurge this season. But it is way cheaper and more sustainable to fix or replace what’s broken. A brand-new display can make your old device seem like new again.
 
2. OPT FOR A MAKEOVER

Sometimes, people get bored with looking at the same old phone every day. That’s why we suggest accessorizing. Go in for a brand-new phone cover instead. Or invest in fun stickers and make your phone unique.
 
3.  IT’S ALL ABOUT SAVINGS

The best discount is the one where you don’t buy something at all. That way, you get 100% savings. Think of it this way. If you don’t buy a new device you really don’t need, you can maybe spend that money on a short holiday. Who doesn’t like some downtime?
 
4.  THINK REFURBISHED

Of course, there are instances where it is time to retire a device and pick up something new. In which case, this time around, think about options that ticks all the boxes for you, while not burdening the planet as much as a brand, new device. Go for a second-hand phone or better yet, a factory refurbished device.
 

This Black Friday, buck the trend and say no to mindless consumerism. This Black Friday, let’s do better.
