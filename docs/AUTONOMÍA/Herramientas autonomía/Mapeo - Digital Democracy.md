##### FREE & ACCESSIBLE GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGY

MAPEO is an offline-first open-source technology which makes it easy for many to use. No internet or special hardware required to collect, view, or share data.

##### QUICK & EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE

With the push of a button, contributors can gather map data by linking GPS points, photos, and notes. All data is completely owned by the communities themselves. And a simple and adaptive interface makes it accessible for many different people to use.

##### DATABASES DEFINED & OWNED BY COMMUNITIES

Communities stay organized and manage documented evidence. Data can be shared between project collaborators with MAPEO's mobile-to-mobile sync feature.

##### CO-DESIGNED WITH COMMUNITIES

We are building MAPEO in close collaboration with indigenous partners in the Amazon, including Achuar, Cocama, Harakbut, Kofan, Kichwa, Matsiguenka, Siekopai, Wapichana, Waorani and Yine peoples. For more on Digital Democracy's partners, visit our [partnership page](https://www.digital-democracy.org/about-us/partners-supporters).

The development of MAPEO has been made possible due to generous grants from the [Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation](https://www.leonardodicaprio.org/), [Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/), [Abundance Foundation](https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/www.abundance.org), [All Eyes on the Amazon](https://alleyesontheamazon.org/) (Dutch Postcode Lottery), and [Samsung Next Zero](https://samsungnext.com/whats-next/category/podcasts/decentralization-samsung-next-stack-zero-grant-recipients/).
